## General Information
- Number Guesser is a game that runs in the browser.
- I undertook this project as a means of improving my fluency in JavaScript.


## How It Works
- The game takes number guesses (between 0 and 9) from both the human playing and the computer.
- A number (between 0 and 9) is randomly chosen to be the target.
- It then determines which player (human or computer) wins based on which guess is closest to the target.
- If both players are tied, the human player wins.
- Feel free to give it a try [here](https://peterkibuchi.github.io/number-guesser/).
